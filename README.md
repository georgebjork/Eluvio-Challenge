# Eluvio-Challenge

This is my submission for the Eluvio challenge option 2.

My solution is a dynamic programming solution that takes about 3 minutes to run. The program will start by parsing all binary files into an unsigned char vector.
It will then use dynamic programming to find the longest strand of bytes between all files.

The algorithm takes about 3  minutes to run and returns the following result: 

The longest strand was found in files sample.2 and sample.3 with offsets 3072 and 17408 with a length of 27648
